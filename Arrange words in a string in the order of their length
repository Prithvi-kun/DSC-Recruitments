Arrange words in a string in the order of their length

Write a function that inputs a string. The function should return the string sorted in ascending order of the length of the words.

Example Test Case:
Input: "This is a cool sentence"
Output: "a is this cool sentence"

Answer:

def asc(a):
    words=a.split()
    sort=words.sorted(words,key=len)
    end=join(sort)
    print(end)
a=input("Enter a sentence: ")

Output:
"a is this cool sentence"
